# Video-Chat
A Video Chat Application made using WebRTC

This is a video chat application made as part of my Udemy Course, [Practical WebRTC: A Complete WebRTC Bootcamp for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-webrtc-a-complete-webrtc-bootcamp-for-beginners/)

The front end is pure HTML,CSS,Javascript. 
The Backend is in Node.js.

Steps to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `node index.js`

There is a second branch to this repository that contains the upgraded version of this video chat application with added buttons like mute, hide camera and leave room.
