# Video-Chat
A Video Chat Application made using WebRTC

This is a video chat application made as part of my Udemy Course, [Practical WebRTC: A Complete WebRTC Bootcamp for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-webrtc-a-complete-webrtc-bootcamp-for-beginners/)

The front end is pure HTML,CSS,Javascript. 
The Backend is in Node.js.

Steps to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Dependencies are all pushed along with the code so you don't need `npm install`
3. Run `node index.js`

There is a second branch to this repository that contains the upgraded version of this video chat application with added buttons like mute, hide camera and leave room.
